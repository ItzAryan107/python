File IO Basics

There are two types of memories
volatile -- RAM
non-volatile -- hard-disk(which get save)

We can have a file in different mode --- like
"rt"- is a default mode
"r" - open file for reading
"w" - open file foe for writing
"x" - creates files if not exists(when the file is already existing then that file will not get create)
"a" - Add more content to a file
"t" - text mode
"b" - binary mode
"+" - using this we can reade and write a file
